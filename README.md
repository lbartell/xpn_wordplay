# XPN A to Z Analysis
by Lena R. Bartell (twitter: @lenabartell)

## Summary

[WXPN radio](http://xpn.org/music-artist/xpn-a-z) in Philly is playing their library of songs in alphabetical order! (twitter: @wxpnfm #XPNAtoZ)

Here's a quick analysis, including code to
(1) Scrape data from the xpn.org playlist website using scrapy spider
(2) Use the MusicBrainz.org online database & API to collect more song metadata
(3) Analyze and export the result.

For a fun, public visualization of the data see my Tableau Viz:
