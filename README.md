# XPN A to Z Analysis

## Summary

In a massive marathon event, WXPN radio in Philadelpha played over 5,000 songs from their library in alphabetical order. The marathon started on November 30 and continued 24/7 until mid-day on December 17, 2016. To learn more, check out their website: [WXPN radio](http://xpn.org/music-artist/xpn-a-z) (on twitter @wxpnfm, #XPNAtoZ). During the marathon, I developed this code to analyze the playlist. 

Here's a quick analysis, including code to
1. Scrape data from the xpn.org playlist website using scrapy spider
2. Use the MusicBrainz.org online database & API to collect more song metadata
3. Analyze and export the result.

For a fun visualization of the data see my Tableau Viz:
